# OpenWRT Wake-on-LAN CLI Script

Script I use when logging in to my router for WoL for hosts in the network.

## Install

Put the script in /usr/sbin, optionally without the `.sh` extension, then
make it executable.

## Running

Requires a hostname for the first parameter, which is the name your router
knows the host by.
